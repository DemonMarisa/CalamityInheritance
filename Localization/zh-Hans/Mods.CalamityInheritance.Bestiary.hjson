	无人知晓女巫灾厄的真名，她的故土群峦叠嶂，其家人在魔法上登峰造极。
	他们教导灾厄如何掌控黑魔法的同时，不会屈服于其带来的负面情绪。
	然而，一天清晨，在与一场冲突后，灾厄醒来并发现其亲人早已命丧黄泉。
	愤怒的暴徒们将他们的尸体钉在十字架上。
	灾厄被仇恨与怒火所吞噬，以至于忘却了父母所教导于她的话语。
	她湮灭了暴徒们的肉身，并用猩红狱火炙烤他们的灵魂，最终，暴徒在痛苦中被送至地狱承受永世折磨。
	之后，灾厄落魄地回到她在山腰雕凿出来，一无所有的山洞中啜泣。

	但是，善良仍掩埋在灾厄的内心深处。
	几周过去了，她无时无刻都在与自我争执达成目的究竟所需何物？
	而这场心理斗争也在日益增深。
	最后，她对暴君的信任消逝了。

SupremeCalamitasLegacy:
	'''
	当亚利姆和他的士兵摧毁了毁灭魔像后，他因灾厄的背叛行径对她降下诅咒。
	由于灾厄早已远遁，蚀心诅咒并未如预期般发作。
	但这还是侵蚀了她的意志，随着时间推移，诅咒愈发使她的心智癫狂。

SupremeCataclysmLegacy:
	'''
	为了从死神手中夺回她的父母与两个兄弟，她开始着手于死灵魔法。
	灾厄成功将其兄弟带回人世时，她听见了一种空渺飘幻，令人着迷的声音，告知她前往丛林寻求庇护。
	在此之后，灾厄被一种未知的力量所吸引，随着它，女巫在恍惚间来到丛林，并发现前往神庙的道路——
	这是丛林暴君亚利姆，那位向她低语之人所居住的雄伟皇宫。
	'''
SupremeCatastropheLegacy:
	'''
	正因灾厄释放出的，那磅礴而又疯狂的毁灭之力，亚利姆能感知到她对奥术无与伦比的掌握。
	在经过亚利姆多次令人信服的劝谏，告诉她何为此世间唯一且真正重要的事物之后，灾厄加入了暴君的铁骑。
	当阿米迪亚斯拒绝在仪式中帮助亚利姆唤醒沉睡的月神时，亚利姆给予了灾厄第一次任务——将汪洋焚灭为旱海。
	而这也是荒漠灾虫暴走的缘由。
	'''
SoulSeekerSupremeLegacy:
	'''
	在某天，灾厄会见亚利姆，并试着通过指出他漏洞百出的逻辑以劝服他。
	亚利姆充耳不闻，并毫不迟疑地将灾厄送出了自己的宫殿。
	同日，她用一颗古老的电池释放了磐石巨像。
	石像横行于神庙之中，而亚利姆与其士兵的注意力也悉数被其吸引。
	灾厄趁机潜入亚利姆的王座之间，窃取了一些对她有所裨益的文件。
	其中载有亚利姆最英勇的敌人——布瑞莱尔和斯塔提斯.
	'''
SCalWormHeart:
	'''
	最终，在布瑞莱尔和斯塔提斯被击杀后，灾厄回到了亚利姆的身边。
	他解除了对灾厄的诅咒，以换取灾厄的绝对臣服与对敌人而言，那难以想象的残酷恣虐。

CosmicElemental: 一个奇怪的构造物。虽然起源不详，但有一点肯定，那就是它的身体核心所通向的地方不属于我们的世界。
// BlightedEye: A failed creation, a clone of the Soul-Seeking Eye, possessing only a physical shell but devoid of a soul.
/* CalamitasCloneLegacy:
	'''
	Yharim's fears were no longer mere illusions: she had betrayed him.
	The reactivated golem, placed within the temple by Calamitas, unleashed a wave of chaos that swept through the hidden laboratory and breached the containment of the developing clones.
	Yharim's forces swiftly destroyed the menacing construct, but the damage had already been done.
	These clones of Calamitas had been created to prevent her very act of betrayal, yet in the wake of this treacherous upheaval (referring to the chaos), one of the clones was set loose.
	This replica wandered aimlessly through the night, devoid of will or purpose, knowing nothing but movement and combat.
	Just as it had been designed from the moment of its creation.

/* LifeSeekerLegacy:
	'''
	However, even with Yharim's personal efforts, they had underestimated the power of Calamitas herself.
	When the project's lead necromancer perished in a calamity while collecting souls from the depths of Hell
	Calamitas took an interest in the death of this seasoned mage. She personally delved into the void of death to retrieve his soul.
	Even though his intellect had been reduced to insane ramblings, she gleaned enough knowledge from his fractured mind to confirm her growing suspicions about Yharim.
	''' */
/* CataclysmLegacy:
	'''
	Numerous attempts at cloning Yharon's clone resulted in painful lessons, yet the experience gained proved invaluable.
	Under the Jungle Tyrant's personal supervision, a clandestine project to clone Calamitas began to take shape.
	With the aid of past experiences and the necromantic arts inherent to Calamitas herself, a physical form was crafted and an artificial soul was infused within it.
	However, the product of this blend of science and dark magic would inevitably be weaker than the original.
	Nevertheless, the experiment itself held significant value.

/* CatastropheLegacy:
	'''
	The absolute ruler of darkness, wielding the power to reduce vast oceans into barren wastelands, a calamity within Hell itself—such is the might of this witch.
	Her "glory" is synonymous with the disasters she has wrought, and she is considered an indispensable gem in Yharim's conquest of the world, all for good reason.
	If she were to rebel, anything Yharim sent against her would be torn asunder.
	Unless he faced her in person—even then, the outcome would remain uncertain.
	Therefore, he requires Calamitas' absolute loyalty as his safeguard.
