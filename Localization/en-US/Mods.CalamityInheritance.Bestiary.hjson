	There is no one who knows the true name of the witch Calamitas. Her homeland is a land of rugged mountains, and her family were masters of magic.
	They taught Calamitas how to wield dark magic without succumbing to the negative emotions it brings.
	However, one morning, after a conflict, Calamitas awoke to find her loved ones slain.
	The frenzied mob had nailed their bodies to crosses.
	Consumed by hatred and rage, Calamitas forgot the lessons her parents had imparted to her.
	She annihilated the mob's physical forms and seared their souls with scarlet inferno, ultimately condemning them to eternal torment in hell.
	Afterward, Calamitas returned to her desolate cave, carved into the mountainside, and wept bitterly.

	However, kindness still lay buried deep within Calamitas's heart.
	Weeks passed, and she found herself embroiled in an internal struggle every moment, questioning what was truly necessary to achieve her goals.
	This psychological battle intensified with each passing day.
	Eventually, her trust in the Yharims vanished.

	'''
	After Yharim and his soldiers destroyed the Devastator Golem, he cursed Calamitas for her act of betrayal.
	However, as Calamitas had already fled, the Heart-Eroding Curse did not take effect as intended.
	Nevertheless, it still gnawed away at her willpower, and over time, the curse increasingly drove her mind to madness.

SupremeCataclysmLegacy:
	'''
	Determined to reclaim her parents and two brothers from the clutches of death, she began delving into the dark arts of necromancy.
	When Calamitas successfully brought her brothers back to the world of the living, she heard an ethereal, mesmerizing voice urging her to seek refuge in the jungle.
	From that moment onward, Calamitas found herself drawn to an unknown force.
	In a daze, she followed it, wandering into the jungle and discovering the path to the temple—the magnificent palace of the Jungle Tyrant, Yharim, who had whispered to her.
	'''
SupremeCatastropheLegacy:
	'''
	It was precisely because of the overwhelming and insane destructive power unleashed by Calamitas that Yharim could perceive her unparalleled mastery of the arcane arts.
	After multiple convincing persuasions from Yharim, who told her what truly mattered in this world and what was the sole purpose worth pursuing, Calamitas joined the tyrant's ranks.
	When Amdusias refused to assist Yharim in awakening the slumbering Lunar Goddess during a ritual, 
	Yharim entrusted Calamitas with her first mission: to reduce the vast ocean into a parched sea.
	This act also marked the reason behind the rampage of the Desert Scourge.

SoulSeekerSupremeLegacy:
	'''
	One day, Calamitas met with Yharim and attempted to persuade him by pointing out the flaws in his logic.
	However, Yharim turned a deaf ear to her words and promptly had her escorted out of his palace.
	On the same day, she utilized an ancient battery to unleash the Colossal Golem of Stone.
	The stone statue rampaged through the temple, drawing the full attention of Yharim and his soldiers.
	Taking advantage of the distraction, Calamitas stealthily infiltrated Yharim's throne room and managed to steal some documents that would prove beneficial to her.
	Among them were records of Yharim's most formidable enemies—Braelor and Statis.
	'''

	Ultimately, after Braelor and Statis were slain, Calamitas returned to Yharim's side.
	In exchange for her absolute obedience and the unimaginably cruel tyranny she would unleash upon their enemies, he lifted the curse that had been placed upon her.

CosmicElemental: A curious construct, and though its origins are unknown, it has been decidedly proven that the core of its body leads to somewhere not of our world.
BlightedEye: A failed creation, a clone of the Soul-Seeking Eye, possessing only a physical shell but devoid of a soul.
CalamitasCloneLegacy:
	'''
	Yharim's fears were no longer mere illusions: she had betrayed him.
	The reactivated golem, placed within the temple by Calamitas, unleashed a wave of chaos that swept through the hidden laboratory and breached the containment of the developing clones.
	Yharim's forces swiftly destroyed the menacing construct, but the damage had already been done.
	These clones of Calamitas had been created to prevent her very act of betrayal, yet in the wake of this treacherous upheaval (referring to the chaos), one of the clones was set loose.
	This replica wandered aimlessly through the night, devoid of will or purpose, knowing nothing but movement and combat.
	Just as it had been designed from the moment of its creation.

LifeSeekerLegacy:
	'''
	However, even with Yharim's personal efforts, they had underestimated the power of Calamitas herself.
	When the project's lead necromancer perished in a calamity while collecting souls from the depths of Hell
	Calamitas took an interest in the death of this seasoned mage. She personally delved into the void of death to retrieve his soul.
	Even though his intellect had been reduced to insane ramblings, she gleaned enough knowledge from his fractured mind to confirm her growing suspicions about Yharim.
	'''
CataclysmLegacy:
	'''
	Numerous attempts at cloning Yharon's clone resulted in painful lessons, yet the experience gained proved invaluable.
	Under the Jungle Tyrant's personal supervision, a clandestine project to clone Calamitas began to take shape.
	With the aid of past experiences and the necromantic arts inherent to Calamitas herself, a physical form was crafted and an artificial soul was infused within it.
	However, the product of this blend of science and dark magic would inevitably be weaker than the original.
	Nevertheless, the experiment itself held significant value.
	'''
CatastropheLegacy:
	'''
	The absolute ruler of darkness, wielding the power to reduce vast oceans into barren wastelands, a calamity within Hell itself—such is the might of this witch.
	Her "glory" is synonymous with the disasters she has wrought, and she is considered an indispensable gem in Yharim's conquest of the world, all for good reason.
	If she were to rebel, anything Yharim sent against her would be torn asunder.
	Unless he faced her in person—even then, the outcome would remain uncertain.
	Therefore, he requires Calamitas' absolute loyalty as his safeguard.
	'''
YharonLegacy:
	'''
	Yharim grew up with no one besides his monstrous cohorts to keep him company after the passing of (nearly) his entire family...with the exception of his loyal dragon guardian, Yharon.
	Long ago, a powerful ranger found an egg within the depths of the Jungle Temple. She gifted the egg to her son, Yharim, to raise as a companion while she was away on her missions. 
	Before the egg hatched it was tossed into the underworld lava, along with Yharim's entire family due to the arrogance and despicable nature of the elder brother. 
	However, the heat of the lava only caused the young dragon to mature more quickly. 
	Soon, it hatched into a furious beast, and was able to save Yharim from his demise, though the same could not be said for the rest of his family.
	Badly burned and filled with hatred and contempt, Yharim slowly crawled onto the back of his faithful companion. 
	The dragon comforted him as best it could before Yharim commanded that they return to the temple, a new power and order was about to rise. 
	From there the dragon aided Yharim in annihilating the corrupt leaders of the jungle and putting the power in the hands of someone with a broken heart and many scars. 
	The dragon was more than just a mere friend to the tyrant, the warmth and light from the dragon's soul often comforted the tyrant king in times of great depression. 
	Without his pet, the tyrant would've been dead long ago.
