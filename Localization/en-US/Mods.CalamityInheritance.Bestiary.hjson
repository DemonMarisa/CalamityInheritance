	There is no one who knows the true name of the witch Calamitas. Her homeland is a land of rugged mountains, and her family were masters of magic.
	They taught Calamitas how to wield dark magic without succumbing to the negative emotions it brings.
	However, one morning, after a conflict, Calamitas awoke to find her loved ones slain.
	The frenzied mob had nailed their bodies to crosses.
	Consumed by hatred and rage, Calamitas forgot the lessons her parents had imparted to her.
	She annihilated the mob's physical forms and seared their souls with scarlet inferno, ultimately condemning them to eternal torment in hell.
	Afterward, Calamitas returned to her desolate cave, carved into the mountainside, and wept bitterly.

	However, kindness still lay buried deep within Calamitas's heart.
	Weeks passed, and she found herself embroiled in an internal struggle every moment, questioning what was truly necessary to achieve her goals.
	This psychological battle intensified with each passing day.
	Eventually, her trust in the Yharims vanished.

	After Yharim and his soldiers destroyed the Devastator Golem, he cursed Calamitas for her act of betrayal.
	However, as Calamitas had already fled, the Heart-Eroding Curse did not take effect as intended.
	Nevertheless, it still gnawed away at her willpower, and over time, the curse increasingly drove her mind to madness.

	Determined to reclaim her parents and two brothers from the clutches of death, she began delving into the dark arts of necromancy.
	When Calamitas successfully brought her brothers back to the world of the living, she heard an ethereal, mesmerizing voice urging her to seek refuge in the jungle.
	From that moment onward, Calamitas found herself drawn to an unknown force.
	In a daze, she followed it, wandering into the jungle and discovering the path to the temple—the magnificent palace of the Jungle Tyrant, Yharim, who had whispered to her.

	It was precisely because of the overwhelming and insane destructive power unleashed by Calamitas that Yharim could perceive her unparalleled mastery of the arcane arts.
	After multiple convincing persuasions from Yharim, who told her what truly mattered in this world and what was the sole purpose worth pursuing, Calamitas joined the tyrant's ranks.
	When Amdusias refused to assist Yharim in awakening the slumbering Lunar Goddess during a ritual, 
	Yharim entrusted Calamitas with her first mission: to reduce the vast ocean into a parched sea.
	This act also marked the reason behind the rampage of the Desert Scourge.

	One day, Calamitas met with Yharim and attempted to persuade him by pointing out the flaws in his logic.
	However, Yharim turned a deaf ear to her words and promptly had her escorted out of his palace.
	On the same day, she utilized an ancient battery to unleash the Colossal Golem of Stone.
	The stone statue rampaged through the temple, drawing the full attention of Yharim and his soldiers.
	Taking advantage of the distraction, Calamitas stealthily infiltrated Yharim's throne room and managed to steal some documents that would prove beneficial to her.
	Among them were records of Yharim's most formidable enemies—Braelor and Statis.

	Ultimately, after Braelor and Statis were slain, Calamitas returned to Yharim's side.
	In exchange for her absolute obedience and the unimaginably cruel tyranny she would unleash upon their enemies, he lifted the curse that had been placed upon her.

CalamitasCloneLegacy:
	'''
	Yharim's fears were no longer mere illusions: she had betrayed him.
	The reactivated golem, placed within the temple by Calamitas, unleashed a wave of chaos that swept through the hidden laboratory and breached the containment of the developing clones.
	Yharim's forces swiftly destroyed the menacing construct, but the damage had already been done.
	These clones of Calamitas had been created to prevent her very act of betrayal, yet in the wake of this treacherous upheaval (referring to the chaos), one of the clones was set loose.
	This replica wandered aimlessly through the night, devoid of will or purpose, knowing nothing but movement and combat.
	Just as it had been designed from the moment of its creation.

	然而，即使是在亚利姆的亲自努力下，他们也低估了灾厄本身的力量。
	当此项目的首席死灵法师迷失于一场从地狱深处收集灵魂的灾难时，灾厄对这位富有经验的法师的死产生了兴趣，并且她亲自将这位法师的灵魂从死亡的虚空中挖掘了出来。
	即使他的智商已经低至疯狂地胡言乱语，但她还是从他支离破碎的头脑中汲取了足够多的知识，而她对亚利姆日益增长的怀疑也因此得到证实。

	克隆犽戎的多次尝试都换来了惨痛的教训，但从中获得的经验却是变得十分宝贵。
	在丛林暴君的亲自监督下，一场尝试克隆灾厄的项目悄然开始布局。
	在过去的经验与灾厄本身所具有的招魂术的帮助下，物理躯壳被塑造，人工灵魂也填充于此。
	但由科学与黑魔法的混合作用下的产物将不可避免弱于原者，不过这次实验本身也非常具有价值。

	黑暗的绝对掌控者，拥有将汪洋大海摧毁成不毛之地的力量，地狱中的灾难，如此强大的一个女巫，她的“荣誉”本身就是她所导致的灾难的同义词，也被认为是亚利姆征服世界中不可或缺的一颗璀璨明珠，这都是具有充分理由的。
	如果她进行反抗，亚利姆派去的任何东西都会被撕碎。
	除非他亲自面临她—即使这样，结局还是充满疑问的。
	所以他需要灾厄对他绝对的忠诚来作为他的保障。
