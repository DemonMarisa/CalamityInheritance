	How are you still alive!?
	Just stop!
	Even if you defeat me you would still have the lord to contend with!
	He has never lost a battle!
	Not even I could defeat him! What hope do you have!?
	He has grown far stronger since we last fought... you stand no chance.
	Well... I suppose this is the end...
	Perhaps one of these times I'll change my mind...
