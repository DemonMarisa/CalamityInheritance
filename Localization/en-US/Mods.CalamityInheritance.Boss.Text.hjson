KillScalOnce: Do you enjoy going through hell?��
KillScalMoreThan4: Don't get me wrong, I like pain too, but you're just ridiculous.
Scal_PlayerDeathMoreThan4: You must enjoy dying more than most people, huh?
Scal_PlayerDeathMoreThan20: Do you have a fetish for getting killed or something?
Scal_PlayerDeathMoreThan50: Alright, I'm done counting. You probably died this much just to see what I'd say.
ScalDown1BulletHell: Alright, let's get started. Not sure why you're bothering.
ScalEnter2BulletHell: You seem so confident, even though you are painfully ignorant of what has yet to transpire.
ScalEnter3BulletHell: Everything was going well until you came along."
ScalEnterBrotherPhase: Brothers, could you assist me for a moment? This ordeal is growing tiresome.
ScalEnter4Phase: Don't worry, I still have plenty of tricks left.
ScalEnter5Phase: Hmm...perhaps I should let the little ones out to play for a while.
ScalEnter6Phase: Impressive...but still not good enough!
ScalEnter7Phase: I'm just getting started!
ScalEnter8Phase: How are you still alive!?
ScalEnterFinalPhase1: Just stop!
ScalEnterFinalPhase2: Even if you defeat me you would still have the lord to contend with!
ScalEnterFinalPhase3: He has never lost a battle!
ScalEnterFinalPhase4: Not even I could defeat him! What hope do you have!?
ScalEnterFinalPhase5: He has grown far stronger since we last fought...you stand no chance.
ScalEnterFinalPhase6: Well...I suppose this is the end...
ScalEnterFinalPhase7: Perhaps one of these times I'll change my mind...
AfterDownScalOnceText: At last I am free...for a time. I'll keep coming back, just like you. Until we meet again, farewell.
FirstTryDownScalText: You didn't die at all huh? Welp, you probably cheated then. Do it again, for real this time...but here's your reward I guess.
PlayerDeath1DownScalText: One death? That's it? ...I guess you earned this then.
PlayerDeath2DownScalText: Two deaths. Good job. Here's your reward.
PlayerDeath3DownScalText: Third time's the charm huh? I guess it is. Here's a special reward.
PlayerCheat: Go to hell.
